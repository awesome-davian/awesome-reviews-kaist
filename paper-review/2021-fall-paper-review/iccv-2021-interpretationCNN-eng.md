## 1. Problem definition

* Despite the success of deep learning models on various tasks, there is **a lack of interpretability to understand the decision logic behind deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**. It requires sufficient interpretability to make deep learning models reliable.
* In this paper, the authors propose to develop **representative interpretations of a CNN to reveal the common semantics data** that contribute to many closely related predictions.
* How can we find such representative interpretations of a trained CNN?

### Setting

Consider image classification using CNNs with RELU activation functions

* $$\cal{X}$$: the space of images

* $$C$$: the number of classes

* $$F:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^C$$: a trained CNN, and $$Class(x)=\argmax_i F_i(x)$$

* a set of reference images $$R\subseteq\mathcal{X}$$

* $$\psi(x)$$: the feature map produced by the last convolutional layer of $$F$$

* $$\Omega=\{\psi(x)\;|\;x\in\mathcal{X} \}$$ the space of feature maps

* $$G:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^C$$, the mapping from the feature map $$\psi(x)$$ to $$Class(x)$$

* $$\mathcal{P}$$: the set of the linear boundaries (hyperplanes) of $$G$$

  {% hint style="info" %}

  * Reference images denote unlabeled images that we want to interpet by this mehod.

    {% endhint %}

### Representaitive Interpretation

Before formulating our problem, we have to specify a goal to find representative interpretations.

* \[Representative interpretation]

  For an input image $$x\in\mathcal{X}$$, a representative interpretation on $$x$$ is an interpretation that reveals the common decision logic of $$F$$.

* It is a general approach to explain a decision logic by using $$G$$, which is the function from the feature map of the last convolutional layer to the class of $$x$$, when analyzing predictions of a trained DNN.

![Decision logic of a CNN](../../.gitbook/assets/23/cnn\_decision\_logic.png)

* \[Linear boundaries]

  The decision logic of $$G$$ can be characterized by a piecewise linear decision boundary that consists of connected pieces of decision hyperplanes. Denote the set of linear boundaries of $$G$$ by $$\cal{P}$$.

* The linear boundaries in $$\cal P$$ partition the space of feature maps $$\Omega$$ into a large number of convex polytopes. Each convex polytope defines a decision region that predicts all the images contained in the region to be the same class.

* Therefore, a good decision region that is a subset of $$\cal P$$ and includes $$x$$ provides an representative interpretation. That is, the goal is to find a good representative interpretation $$P(x)\subseteq\mathcal{P}$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
\[Goal]

For an input image $$x$$, find a representative interpretation that provides a good decision region $$P(x)\subseteq\mathcal{P}$$.
{% endhint %}

### Finding Representative Interpretations

What is a 'good' representative interpretations? It requires two conditions:

1. Maximize the representativeness of $$P(x)$$.

   \-> A decision region $$P(x)$$ have to cover the large number of reference images.

   \-> maximize $$|P(x)\cap R|$$

2. Avoid covering images in different classes.

   → $$|P(x)\cap D(x)|=0$$ where $$D(x)=\{x'\in R\;|\;Class(x')\neq Class(x)\}$$

It can be formulated as the following optimization problem.

* Co-clustering problem

$$
\max_{P(x)\subseteq\mathcal{P}}|P(x)\cap R|\\ \mathsf{s.t.}\quad|P(x)\cap D(x)|=0
$$

## 2. Motivation

### Related Work

There are various types of existing interpretation methods for CNNs.

1. Conceptual interpretation methods
   * identify a set of concepts that contribute to the predictions on a pre-defined group of conceptually similar images.
   * These methods require sophisticated customization on deep neural networks.
2. Example-based methods
   * Find exemplar images to interpret the decision of a deep neural network.
   * Prototype-based methods summarize the entire model using a small number of instances as prototypes.
   * The selection of prototypes considers little about the decision process of the model.

### Idea

In this paper, the goal is to provide representative interpretations in a general CNN model by considering decision boundaries.

* Find the linear decision boundaries of the convex polytopes that encode the decision logic of a trained CNN.
* This problem can be formulated as a co-clustering problem.
* Convert the co-clustering problem into a submodular cost submodular cover (SCSC) problem to make the problem feasible.

## 3. Method

A set optimization problem such as the co-clustering problem introduced in Section 1 is very complex to optimize. Therefore, in this paper, the authors:

1. sample $$\cal Q$$ from $$\cal P$$ to reduce the size;
2. define submodular optimization problem to make the problem feasible. 

{% hint style="info" %}
What is Submodular Optimization?

* A set optimization problem which finds a optimal subset from candidates is computationally complex, since the computational cost increases exponentially as the number of candidates increase.
* When the objective function satisfies submodularity, the greedy algorithm achieves at least a constant fraction of the objective value obtained by the optimal solution.
* Therefore, submodular optimization makes a set optimization problem feasible with guaranteeing a sufficently good performance.
* Submodularity requires diminishing return property. You can check the details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submodular\_set\_function).
  {% endhint %}

### Submodular Cost Submodular Cover problem

* SCSC problem

$$
\max_{P(x)\subseteq\mathcal{Q}}|P(x)\cap R|\\ \mathsf{s.t.}\quad|P(x)\cap D(x)|\leq\delta
$$

* We can construct a set of linear boundaries $$\cal P$$ from function $$G$$ by [the method introduced in this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3219819.3220063?casa\_token=MojIMpYRbLcAAAAA:19vihLVFk09s\_3zS1mtVpaxYvX7Cor5Fbkvso6UlSJYhW\_qPkO2oM7MCKIqJrTZ\_GgQsPeNgC8RK).

* Sample a subset of linear boundaries $$\cal Q$$ from $$\cal P$$.

* Due to sampling, the images covered in the same convex polytope may not be predicted by $$F$$ as the same class 
  → Relax the constraint $$|P(x)\cap D(x)|=0$$ into $$|P(x)\cap D(x)|\leq\delta$$.

* This formulation satisfies conditions for submodular cost and submodular cover. You can check it in Appendix A of [the paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Lam\_Finding\_Representative\_Interpretations\_on\_Convolutional\_Neural\_Networks\_ICCV\_2021\_paper.html).

* Finally, the SCSC problem can be solved by iteratively selecting a linear boundary through the following greedy algorithm.

  ![The greedy algorithm to find representative interpretations.](../../.gitbook/assets/23/greedy\_alg.png)

### Ranking Similar Images

Define a new semantic distance to evaluate images $$x'\in P(x)$$.

* Semantic distance

  $$
  Dist(x.x')=\sum_{\mathbf{h}\in P(x)}\Big\vert \langle \overrightarrow{W}_\mathbf{h},\psi(x)\rangle -\langle \overrightarrow{W}_\mathbf{h},\psi(x')\rangle \Big\vert
  $$

* $$\overrightarrow{W}_\mathbf{h}$$ is the normal vector of the hyperplane of a linear boundary $$\mathbf{h}\in P(x)$$.

* That is, it measures how far $$x'$$ is from $$x$$ in terms of hyperplanes in $$P(x)$$. 

* Rank the images covered by $$P(x)$$ according to their semantic distance to $$x$$ in ascending order.

## 4. Experiment & Result

### Experimental setup

The authors compare representative interpretation (RI) method with Automatic Concept-based Explanation(ACE), CAM-based methods(Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM).

* Apply sampling with $$|\mathcal{Q}|=50$$.
* Such methodologies use channel weights to provide interpretability. Reuse the channel weights computed from the input image $$x\in\mathcal{X}$$, and follow the same heat mapto generate the interpretation for $$x_{new}$$. Compare the results from the methodologies.
  * In the case of RI, use the semantic distance to find a set of similar images $$x_{new}$$.
  * In the other cases, use the Euclidean distance in the space of $$\Omega$$ to find a set of similar images $$x_{new}$$.
* Dataset: Gender Classification (GC), ASIRRA, Rentinal OCT Images (RO), FOOD datasets
* Target model: VGG-19

### Result

#### Case Study

* This experiment evaluate if each method provides a proper interpretation for similar images.
* The first row shows the result retrieved by RI method. Unlike the other methods, the heat maps in images indicate consistent semantics in the images.
* RI method can successfully find the interpretation for the input image, as well as a set of images sharing the same interpretation.

#### Quantitative Experiment

In this experiment, the authors quantitatively evaluate how computed interpretations can be used to classify unseen dataset. The following two measures:

* Average Drop (AD)

  $$
  \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{e\in S}\frac{\max(0,Y_c(e)-Y_c(e'))}{Y_c(e)}
  $$

* Average Increase (AI)

  $$
  \frac{1}{|S|}\sum_{e\in S}\mathbb{1}_{Y_c(e)<Y_c(e')}
  $$

* $$S\subseteq \mathcal{X}$$: a set of unseen images

* $$Y_c(e)$$: the prediction score for class $$c$$ in an image $$e\in S$$

* $$e'$$: a masked image produced by keeping 20% of the most important pixels in $$e$$

When keeping only important pixels in the image, AD indicates a decrease in accuracy and AI indicates the percentage of samples that increases in accuracy. A small mean AD(mAD) and a large mean AI(mAI) say that the interpretation can be validly reused to accurately identify important regions on the unseen images in $$S$$. In the figure, we can see that RI method achieve the best performances in most cases.

## 5. Conclusion

- In this paper, a co-clustering problem is formulated to interpret the decision-making process of CNN by considering decision boundaries.
- To solve the co-clustering problem, the greedy algorithm can be applied by converting it into the SCSC problem.

* It has been experimentally shown that proposed representative interpretations reflect common semantics in the unseen images.

### Take home message

> As deep neural networks have been widely used in various fields, it is more important to interpret a decision logic of DNNs. In this spirit, it is impressive to suggest representative interpretations by considering decision boundaries and I hope to extend such studies further.
