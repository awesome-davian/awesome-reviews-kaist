## Self-Calibrating Neural Radiance Fields \[Kor]

\*\*\*\*[**English version**](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md) of this article is available.

## 1. Problem definition

해당 논문에서는 하나의 scene을 촬영한 여러장의 이미지가 입력으로주어졌을 때, 이미지를 촬영할 때 사용된 카메라의 intrinsic/extrinsic parameter와 Neural Radiance Field 형태로 표현된 해당 scene의 geometry를 동시에 학습합니다. 일반적으로 카메라의 intrinsic/extrinsic을 추정할 때는 checker board와 같은 calibration pattern을 촬영한 이미지가 필요하지만 해당 논문에서는 calibration pattern없이도calibration이 가능합니다.

tion$M(image;\theta)$&#x20;

$$
\mathbf{r}=f(K,R,t,k,r_d,r_o)\
$$
