## 1. Problem definition

해당 논문(약칭 SCNeRF) 에서는 하나의 scene을 촬영한 여러장의 이미지가 입력으로주어졌을 때, 이미지를 촬영할 때 사용된 카메라의 intrinsic/extrinsic parameter와 해당 scene의 geometry를 표현하는 Neural Radiance Field 파라미터를 동시에 학습합니다. 일반적으로 카메라의 intrinsic/extrinsic을 추정할 때는 checker board와 같은 calibration pattern을 촬영한 이미지가 필요하지만 해당 논문에서는 calibration pattern을 촬영한 이미지 없이 calibration을 수행이 가능합니다.

수식으로는 아래와 같이 표현할 수 있습니다.

> Find $$K, R, t, k, r_{o}, r_{d}, \theta$$, when
>
> $$\mathbf{r}=(\mathbf{r_o}, \mathbf{r_d})=f_{cam}(K, R, t, k, r_o, r_d)$$
>
> $$\hat{\mathbf{C}}(\mathbf{r})=f_{nerf}(\mathbf{r};\theta)$$

여기서 $$\mathbf{r}$$은ray, $$\mathbf{r_o}$$와 $$\mathbf{r_d}$$는 ray의 origin과 direction, $$f_{cam}$$은 카메라 파라미터로부터 ray를 생성해내는 함수, $$(K,R,t,k,r_o,r_d)$$는 카메라 calibration 파라미터, $$\hat{\mathbf{C}}(\mathbf{r})$$는 ray $$\mathbf{r}$$에 대한 color 추정값, $$\theta$$는 Neural Radiance Field 모델 파라미터, $$f_{nerf}$$는 ray가 주어졌을 때 $$\theta$$를 이용하여 이미지를 rendering하는 함수를 의미합니다.

기존의 방법들은 카메라 파라미터를 알고있다는 가정 하에 scene의 geometry만 학습하거나, scene geometry에 대한 학습 없이 카메라 파라미터만을 학습했다면, 본 논문의 목적은 $$(K,R,t,k,r_o,r_d)$$와 $$\theta$$를 동시에 학습하는 것입니다.

## 2. Motivation

### Related work

#### Camera Model

간결성과 보편성 때문에 기존의 3D vision task 는 핀홀 카메라 모델 가정을 많이 사용해왔습니다. 그러나, 카메라 모델의 발전과 함께 어안렌즈 카메라, 일반화모델 등 다양한 종류의 카메라 모델이 등장했고, 기본적인 핀홀 카메라 모델은 이런 복잡한 형태의 카메라 모델을 표현하는 것에 한계가 존재합니다.

#### Camera Self-Calibration

self-calibration은 카메라 파라미터를 별도의 calibration용 물체(ex 체커보드패턴) 없이도 탐색하고자 하는 연구분야입니다. 많은 경우, calibration 물체를 촬영한 이미지를 구하는 것은 불가능하기 때문에 (예를들어 인터넷에서 크롤링한 이미지 사용하는 경우) calibration 물체가 없이도 camera calibration을 수행하는 self-calibration은 중요한 연구 분야입니다. 하지만, 기존의 self-calibration 방법들은 온전히 geometric loss 에 의존하거나, sparse한 대응점간의 정보만을 이용하는 epipolar geometry에 의존하고 있습니다. 이러한 방법든은 촬영된 scene에 충분한 feature가 존재하지 않을 때 noise에 극도로 민감해져 결과가 발산하고만다는 단점이 존재합니다. 또한 더 정확한 scene의 geometry를 알 수록 더 정확한 카메라 모델을 얻을 수 있음에도 불구하고, 기존의 self-calibration 방법들은 geometry를 개선하거나 학습하는 과정을 포함하지 않습니다.

#### Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF) for Novel View Synthesis

NeRF is a work that synthesizes a novel view of the scene by optimizing a separate neural continuous volume representation network for each scene.

At the time when the NeRF was published, this work achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views.

However, this requires not only a dataset of captured RGB images of the scene but also the corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters, which are not always available.

#### Camera Self/Auto-Calibration

Camera Self-Calibration은 별도의 calibration object없이 카메라의 파라미터를 추정하는 분야입니다. 별도의 calibration object가 없어도 카메라 파라미터를 추정할 수 있다는 장점이 있으나, 일반적인 Camera Self-Calibration 방법론들은 sparse한 대응점들만을 사용하는 geometric loss만을 사용하거나 epipolar geometry 가정에 의존하기 때문에 scene이 충분히 많은 feauture를 갖지 않는 경우 결과값이 발산합니다. 또한 더 정확한 scene의 geometry를 알 수록 더 정확한 카메라 모델을 얻을 수 있음에도 불구하고, 일반적인 self-calibration 방법론들은 geometry를 개선하거나 학습하는 과정을 포함하지 않습니다.

#### Novel View Synthesis

## 2. Motivation

### Related work

#### Camera Model

Because of its simplicity and generality, traditional 3D vision tasks often assume that the camera model is a simple pinhole model. However, with the development of camera models, various camera models have been introduced, including fish eye models, and per-pixel generic models. A basic pinhole camera model is not enough to represent these kinds of complex camera models.

#### Camera Self-Calibration

Self-Calibration is a research topic that calibrates camera parameters without an external calibration object (e.g., a checkerboard pattern) in the scene.

In many cases, calibration objects are not readily available. Thus, calibrating camera parameters without any external objects has been an important research topic.

However, conventional self-calibration methods solely rely on the geometric loss or constraints based on the epipolar geometry that only uses a set of sparse correspondences extracted from a non-differentiable process. This could lead to diverging results with extreme sensitivity to noise when a scene does not have enough interest points. Lastly, conventional self-calibration methods use an off-the-shelf non-differentiable feature matching algorithm and do not improve or learn the geometry. It is well known that the better we know the geometry of the scene, the more accurate the camera model gets.

#### Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF) for Novel View Synthesis

NeRF is a work that synthesizes a novel view of the scene by optimizing a separate neural continuous volume representation network for each scene.

At the time when the NeRF was published, this work achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views.

However, this requires not only a dataset of captured RGB images of the scene but also the corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters, which are not always available.

### Idea

* Pinhole camera model parameters, fourth-order radial distortion parameters, and generic noise model parameters that can learn arbitrary non-linear camera distortions are included to overcome the limitation of the pinhole camera model.
* To overcome the limitation of geometric loss used in the previous self-calibration methods, additional photometric consistency is used.
* To get a more accurate camera model using improved geometry of the scene, the geometry represented using Neural Radiance Fields is learned jointly.

## 3. Method

### Differentiable Camera Model

#### Pinhole Camera Model

The first component of differentiable camera unprojection is based on the pinhole camera model, which maps a 4-vector homogeneous coordinate in 3D space $$P_{4 \times 1}$$ to a 3-vector in the image plane $$P'_{3 \times 1}$$.

$$
P'_{3\times1} = M_{3\times4}P=K_{3\times3}\left[R\; T\right]_{3\times 4} P_{4\times 1}
$$

Where $$K$$ is the intrinsics matrix, $$R$$ is the rotation matrix, $$T$$ is the translation matrix

First, the camera intrinsic parameters are decomposed into the initialization $$K_0$$ and the residual parameter matrix $$\Delta K$$(=$$z_K$$). This is due to the highly non-convex nature of the intrinsics matrix that has a lot of local minima.

$$
K=\begin{bmatrix} f_x+\Delta f_x & 0 & c_x + \Delta c_x \\ 0 & f_y + \Delta f_y & c_y + \Delta c_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = K_0 + \Delta K \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}
$$

Similarly, the extrinsics initial values $$R_0$$ and $$t_0$$ and residual parameters to represent the camera rotation R and translation t. However, directly learning the rotation offset for each element of a rotation matrix would break the orthogonality of the rotation matrix. Thus, the 6-vector representation which uses unnormalized first two columns of a rotation matrix is utilized to represent a 3D rotation:

$$
\mathbf{t} = \mathbf{t_0} + \Delta \mathbf{t}\\R=f(\mathbf{a_0}+\Delta \mathbf{a})\\f\begin{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} | & | \\ a_1& a_2\\ | & | \end{bmatrix}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}|&|&|\\\mathbf{b_1} & \mathbf{b_2} & \mathbf{b_3}\\| & | & |\end{bmatrix}_{3 \times 3}
$$

What $$f$$ does is quite similar to Gram-Schmidt process. To make it clear, I draw conceptual image as follows. Here, $$N(\cdot)$$ is $$L2$$ normalization.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/gram\_schmidt\_like\_process.png)

As we can see in the figure, from unnormalized two vectors $$\mathbf{a_1}$$ and $$\mathbf{a_2}$$, orthonormal vectors $$\mathbf{b_1}, \mathbf{b_2}, \mathbf{b_3}$$ can be obtained.

####

#### Fourth Order Radial Distortion

Since commercial lenses deviates from ideal lens with single lens focal length, this creates a number of aberrations. The most common one is referred to as “radial distortion”.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/radial\_distortion\_types.png)

Camera model of SCNeRF is extended to incorporate such radial distortions.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/H360\_barrel\_distortion.png)

Undistorted normalized pixel coordinate $$(n'_x, n'_y)$$ converted from pixel coordinate $$(p_x, p_y)$$ can be expresses as the following.

$$
(n_x, n_y) = (\frac{p_x-c_x}{f_x},\frac{p_y-c_y}{f_y})\\r=\sqrt{n^2_x+n^2_y}\\\left[n'_x, n'_y, 1 \right]^T = K^{-1} \left[p_x(1+(k_1+z_{k_1}) r^2 + (k_2+z_{k_2}) r^4), p_y(1+(k_1+z_{k_1}) r^2 + (k_2+z_{k_2}) r^4),1 \right]
$$

where $$(k_1, k_2)$$ is initial radial distortion parameter denoted as $$k_0$$ and $$(z_{k_1}, z_{k_2})$$ are residuals denoted as $$z_k$$.

#### Ray Direction & Origin

Using[#pinhole-camera-model](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md#pinhole-camera-model "mention") and [#fourth-order-radial-distortion](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md#fourth-order-radial-distortion "mention"), ray direction $$\mathbf{r_d}$$ and ray origin $$\mathbf{r_o}$$ in the world coordinate can be expressed as the following.

$$
\mathbf{r_d} = N(R \cdot \left[n'_x, n'_y, 1 \right]^T)\\\mathbf{r_o}=\mathbf{t}
$$

where $$N(\cdot)$$ is vector normalization. For those who may confuse why $$\mathbf{t}$$ equals the ray origin $$\mathbf{r_o}$$ in the world coordinate, I draw conceptual image that shows the geometric meaning of vector $$\mathbf{t}$$.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/H360\_ray\_origin\_t.png)

Since these ray parameters $$\mathbf{r_d}$$ and $$\mathbf{r_o}$$ are functions of intrinsics, extrinsics, and dirtortion paramameter residuals ($$\Delta f, \Delta c, \Delta a, \Delta t, \Delta k$$), we can pass gradients from the rays to the residuals to optimize the parameters. Note that $$K_0,R_0, t_0, k_0$$are initial values of each parameters and not optimized.

#### Generic Non-Linear Camera Distortion

Complex optical abberations in real lenses cannot be modeled using a parametric camera. For such noise, generic non-linear aberration model is used. Specifically, local ray parameter residuals $$\mathbf{z_d} = \Delta \mathbf{r}_d(\mathbf{p})$$, $$\mathbf{z}_o = \Delta \mathbf{r}_o(\mathbf{p})$$ is used, where $$\mathbf{p}$$ is the image coordinate.

$$
\mathbf{r}'_d = \mathbf{r}_d + \mathbf{z}_d \\\mathbf{r}'_o=\mathbf{r}_o+\mathbf{z}_o
$$

Bilinear interpolation is used to extract continuous ray distortion parameters.

$$
\mathbf{z}_d(\mathbf{p}) = \sum_{x=\lfloor\mathbf{p}_x\rfloor}^{\lfloor\mathbf{p}_x\rfloor+1}\sum_{x=\lfloor\mathbf{p}_y\rfloor}^{\lfloor\mathbf{p}_y\rfloor+1} \left(1-|x-\mathbf{p}_x|\right)\left(1-|y-\mathbf{p}_y|\right)\mathbf{z}_d\left[x,y\right]
$$

where $$\mathbf{z}_d[x, y]$$ indicates the ray direction offset at a control point in discrete 2D coordinate $$(x, y)$$. $$\mathbf{z}_d[x, y]$$ is learned at discrete locations only. Dual comes for free.

$$
\mathbf{z}_o(\mathbf{p}) = \sum_{x=\lfloor\mathbf{p}_x\rfloor}^{\lfloor\mathbf{p}_x\rfloor+1}\sum_{x=\lfloor\mathbf{p}_y\rfloor}^{\lfloor\mathbf{p}_y\rfloor+1} \left(1-|x-\mathbf{p}_x|\right)\left(1-|y-\mathbf{p}_y|\right)\mathbf{z}_o\left[x,y\right]
$$

To help your understanding, the conceptual image of a generic non-linear aberration model is attached below.

#### Computational Graph of Ray Direction & origin

From [#pinhole-camera-model](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md#pinhole-camera-model "mention"), [#fourth-order-radial-distortion](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md#fourth-order-radial-distortion "mention"), [#generic-non-linear-camera-distortion](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md#generic-non-linear-camera-distortion "mention"), the final ray direction and ray origin can be expressed using the following graph.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/figure2.png)

### Loss

To optimize calibration parameters, both geometric consistency loss and photometric consistency loss is exploited.

#### Geometric Consistency Loss

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/geometric\_consistency\_loss\_overall.png)

Geometric Consistency Loss is $$d_\pi$$ in the above figure. Let's break this down into pieces.

First, let $$\left(\mathbf{p_A} \leftrightarrow \mathbf{p_B}\right)$$ be a correspondence on camera 1 and 2 respectively. The projected ray distance loss directly measures the discrepancy between rays. When all the camera parameters are calibrated, the ray $$\mathbf{r}_A$$ and $$\mathbf{r}_B$$ should intersect at the 3D point that generated point $$\mathbf{p}_A$$ and $$\mathbf{p}_B$$. However, when there’s a misalignment due to an error in camera parameters, we can measure the deviation by computing the shortest distance between corresponding rays.

Let a point on $$\mathbf{r}_A$$ be $$\mathbf{x}_A(t_A) = \mathbf{r}_{o,A} + t_A\mathbf{r}_{d,A}$$, and a point on $$\mathbf{r}_B$$ be $$\mathbf{x}_B(t_B) = \mathbf{r}_{o,B} + t_A\mathbf{r}_{d,B}$$. A distance between the $$\mathbf{r}_A$$ and a point on the $$\mathbf{r}_B$$ is $$d$$ as we can see in the above figure.

Solving $$\frac{\mathbf{d}d^2}{\mathbf{d}t_B}|_{\hat{t}_B}=0$$ gives us $$\hat{t}_B$$ that makes the distance between $$\mathbf{x}_B$$ and $$\mathbf{r}_A$$ minimum.

$$
\hat{t}_B = \frac{\left(\mathbf{r}_{A,o}-\mathbf{r}_{B,o}\right) \times \mathbf{r}_{A,d}\cdot \left( \mathbf{r}_{A,d} \times \mathbf{r}_{B,d}\right)}{\left(\mathbf{r}_{A,d}\times\mathbf{r}_{B,d}\right)^2}
$$

From this, we can find a point on ray B that has the shortest distance to ray A.

$$
\mathbf{x_B} = \mathbf{x_B}(\hat{t}_B)
$$

Dual comes for free.

$$
\mathbf{x_A} = \mathbf{x_A}(\hat{t}_A)
$$

After projecting the points to image planes and computing distance on the image planes, geometric consistency loss $$d_\pi$$ in the above figure can be obtained, where $$\pi(\cdot)$$ is a projection function.

Note that correspondences for a point far from the cameras would have a large deviation, while correspondences for a point close to the cameras would have a small deviation. Thus, to remove this depth sensitivity, the distance between the two points is computed on the image plane, not 3D space.

#### Photometric Consistency Loss

Photometric consistency loss is defined as the following.

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{I}}||C(\mathbf{p})-\hat{C}(\mathbf{r(p)})||^2_2
$$

where $$\mathbf{p}$$ is a pixel coordinate, and $$\mathcal{I}$$ is a set of pixel coordinates in an image, $$\hat{C}(\mathbf{r})$$ is the output of the volumetric rendering using the ray $$\mathbf{r}$$ of corresponding pixel $$\mathbf{p}$$, $$C(\mathbf{p})$$ is the ground truth color.

> **HOW TO ESTIMATE** $$\hat{C}(\mathbf{r})$$**?**
>
> The color value $$\mathbf{C}$$ of a ray can be represented as an integral of all colors weighted by the opaqueness along a ray, or can be approximated as the weighted sum of colors at N points along a ray as following.
>
> $$\mathbf{\hat{C}} \approx \sum_i^N\left( \prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\alpha (\mathbf{r}(t_j), \Delta_j) \right)\left( 1-\alpha(t_i, \Delta_i) \right) \mathbf{c}\left( \mathbf{r}(t_i), \mathbf{v} \right)$$
>
> where $$\alpha(\cdot)$$ is transparency, $$\mathbf{c(\cdot)}$$is color, $$\Delta_i = t_{i+1}-t_{i}$$
>
> For those who want to learn more about this equation, please refer the "NeRF" paper in[#reference-and-additional-materials](iccv-2021-scnerf-eng.md#reference-and-additional-materials "mention")

Note that photometric consistency loss is differentiable with respect to the learnable camera parameters. From this, we can define gradients for the camera parameters and ablel to calibrate cameras.

### Curriculum Learning

It is impossible to learn accurate camera parameters when the geometry is unknown or too coarse for self-calibration. Thus, curriculum learning is adopted: geometry and a linear camera model first and complex camera model parameters.

First, NeRF network is trained while initializing the camera focal lengths and focal centers to half the image width and height. Learning coarse geometry first is crucial since it initializes the networks to a more favorable local optimum for learning better camera parameters.

Next, camera parameters for the linear camera model, radial distortion, nonlinear noise of ray direction, and ray origin are sequentially added to the learning.

Following is the final learning algorithm. $$get\_params$$ function returns a set of parameters of the curriculum learning which returns a set of parameters for the curriculum learning which progressively adds complexity to the camera model.

Next, the model is trained with the projected ray distance by selecting a target image at random with sufficient correspondences.

### Improvement over NeRF

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/table1.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/W400\_table2.png)

Table 1 reports the qualities of the rendered images in the training set. Although SCNeRF model does not adopt calibrated camera information, it shows a reliable rendering performance.

SCNeRF model shows better rendering qualities than NeRF when COLMAP initializes the camera information. Table 2 reports the rendering qualities of NeRF and SCNeRF. SCNeRF consistently shows better rendering qualities than the original NeRF.

Following is the visualization of the rendered images.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/figure7.png)

### Ablation Study

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2022spring/35/table5.png)

To check the effects of the proposed models, an ablation study is conducted. Each phase is trained for 200K iterations. From this experiment, extending the SCNeRF model with learnable intrinsic and extrinsic parameters(IE), non-linear distortion(OD), and projected ray distance loss(PRD) is more potential for rendering clearer images. However, for some scenes, adopting projected ray distance increases the overall projected ray distance, even though it is not stated in the table.

Following is the visualization of the ablation study.

## 5. Conclusion

### Summary

SCNeRF proposes a self-calibration algorithm that learns geometry and camera parameters jointly end-to-end. The camera model consists of a pinhole model, radial distortion, and non-linear distortion, which capture real noises in lenses. We also propose projected ray distance to improve accuracy, which allows our model to learn fine-grained correspondences. We show that our model learns geometry and camera parameters from scratch when the poses are not given, and our model improves both NeRF to be more robust when camera poses are given.

### Personal Opinion

* In my perspective, this paper is worthy because it shows a way to calibrate camera parameters and neural radiance fields jointly.
* I wonder why the result in the paper reports training set accuracy instead of val/test set accuracy.
* Some errors are noticed in equations and corrected as I think they should be. Please feel free to comment if you find any errors in the equations used in this article.
